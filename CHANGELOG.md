# Changelog

All notable changes to FiHaven are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project
follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Each release below uses two layers:

| Section | Audience |
|---------|----------|
| **Summary** | Testers, app users, release notes — no jargon |
| **Technical changelog** | Developers — APIs, files, flags, build detail |

## [1.5.0] (Pre-Release) — Last updated: 2026-07-01

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | Pre-release |
| **iOS** | 1.5.0 (4) |
| **Android** | 1.5.0 (build 13) |

### Summary

> Rewards and optional bank linking on the live site — plus autopay timing and
> reliability fixes. [Jump to technical changelog ↓](#150-technical-changelog)

**Smarter Credit Card rewards**

- See recurring card perks (Uber credits, airline fees, etc.) and log what you’ve
  used each month — plus a “is this annual fee worth it?” check on the Rewards tab.
- Track activated card offers (Amex/Chase deals) before they expire; mark them
  used when you’re done and get a heads-up before they lapse.
- FiHaven can suggest which card to use at a store based on where you’re shopping.

**Bank linking (Pro, optional)**

- Connect your bank on **fihaven.app** — live in production, not dev-only.
- If your bank adds accounts later, link them without starting over.
- Spending can flag when a bank import looks like a purchase you already entered
  by hand (you choose what to keep).
- Opt in to updating card balances from the bank; by default FiHaven never
  overwrites what you typed.

**Bills & cards**

- Set a separate **autopay day** from the due date so “mark paid” lines up with
  when your bank actually pulls payment.

**Sign in**

- Sign in with a **passkey** — no password. Your device offers a saved passkey
  right on the login screen (Face ID / Touch ID, iCloud Keychain, Google
  Password Manager, Bitwarden, and friends) on web, iOS, and Android.

**Reliability**

- Fixed cards, bills, accounts, and goals not showing up on Android (and a
  save bug that could drop accounts/goals/transactions on phones).
- The login security check no longer “times out” if you leave the sign-in
  screen open for a while — it refreshes itself.
- Android now autofills the 2FA code correctly instead of offering a password,
  and the sign-up screen shows the Terms/Privacy agreement.
- Stronger Android sign-in security and more reliable iOS TestFlight builds.

**Build 4 polish**

- Changing your email now requires a verified current address; the new address
  must be confirmed before it takes effect (web, iOS, Android).
- Android can register and remove passkeys in Settings; passkey enrollment
  accepts Play-signed app origins.
- Google Play Pro subscriptions are verified server-side via the Developer API.
- Android login no longer shows “session expired” on a wrong password; auth
  screens scroll above the keyboard and settings dialogs size to their content.
- Play Store upload signing via local `keystore.properties` (documented in
  `android/README.md`).

**Build 3 polish**

- Fixed cards and bills showing “overdue” after you’ve already paid this period.
- Fixed FiHaven Pro “Manage subscription” for Stripe subscribers; clearer
  messaging for complimentary and promo access.
- Fixed the dashboard **More** menu and settings tab bar on the web.
- Updated the marketing homepage to reflect live apps, sync, and bank linking.

### Technical changelog

#### Added

- **Card perks** — recurring statement credits with per-cycle usage logging;
  annual-fee worth-it check (fee vs perk value + estimated category rewards) on
  web, iOS, and Android Rewards tab (`perks.js` ⇄ `Perks.swift` / `Perks.kt`).
- **Card-linked offers** — manual tracker for activated issuer deals; active
  list, mark-used, and Plaid-assisted use suggestions (`offers.js` ⇄ native
  cores).
- **Merchant → category hints** — Rewards optimizer maps merchant names to
  spending categories (`merchants.js` ⇄ native cores).
- **Offer expiry reminders** — email (`sendOfferReminder`) and on-device
  notifications when `settings.offerReminders` is on.
- **Bank reconciliation** — Spending panel flags duplicate manual/bank pairs,
  unmatched Plaid rows, and unconfirmed manual entries; manual resolution
  (`reconcile.js` ⇄ `Reconcile.swift` / `Reconcile.kt`).
- **Plaid balance sync (opt-in)** — `settings.plaidUpdateBalances` updates card
  owed balances on unambiguous last-4 match only (`plaidBalances.js`; server-side;
  off by default).
- **Autopay pull day** — optional `autopayDay` on bills and cards, separate from
  `dueDay`; drives auto-mark timing on web, iOS, and Android.

#### Added

- **Passwordless passkey sign-in** — log in with a device passkey (Face ID /
  Touch ID, iCloud Keychain, Google Password Manager, Bitwarden, etc.) and no
  password. New first-factor endpoints `POST /api/auth/passkey/login/start` +
  `/finish` (`mfa.startPasskeyLogin`/`finishPasskeyLogin`, discoverable
  credentials, user-verification required) resolve the account from the signed
  credential id. The login screen runs a check automatically: **web** conditional
  UI (`autocomplete="… webauthn"` + `useBrowserAutofill`), **iOS** ASAuthorization
  AutoFill-assisted requests (+ a “Sign in with a passkey” button), **Android**
  Credential Manager `GetPublicKeyCredentialOption`. Adds association files served
  from `/.well-known/` (`apple-app-site-association`, `assetlinks.json`), the iOS
  `webcredentials:fihaven.app` entitlement, and an optional
  `PASSKEY_ANDROID_ORIGIN` env for the Android `apk-key-hash` origin. (Passkeys
  also remain available as a second factor.)

#### Added

- **Google Play receipt verification** — `server/googlePlay.js` calls
  `purchases.subscriptionsv2.get` when `GOOGLE_VERIFY_ENABLED=1`;
  `upload.sh` can ship `GOOGLE_PLAY_SA_LOCAL` → server JSON path.
- **Android passkey registration** — Settings → Passkeys uses Credential
  Manager (`PasskeyRegistration.kt`); `passkeyOrigins(req)` on enroll/finish
  (`server/mfa.js`).
- **`scripts/seed-user-data.js`** — demo/screenshot account seeding CLI.

#### Changed

- **Change-email verification gate** — `POST /api/account/change-email` requires
  a verified current email, clears `email_verified`, emails the new address, and
  returns `verificationRequired`; clients hide change-email when unverified.
- **Android release signing** — optional `keystore.properties` + `bundleRelease`
  (`android/app/build.gradle.kts`, `keystore.properties.example`).
- **Android release build 13** — R8 minify/shrink + `proguard-rules.pro` for Play
  deobfuscation mapping; `ndk.debugSymbolLevel = symbol_table` for native crash
  symbols (`versionCode` 13).
- **Marketing homepage** — `home.html` reflects TestFlight/live apps, sync,
  family, passkeys, and Plaid (`pricing.html` one-liner).
- **Android Plaid Link SDK 6** — migrated to Plaid Link SDK 6.0.0; `compileSdk`
  37 and lifecycle 2.11.0.
- **Plaid production deploy** — `upload.sh` ships sanitized `PLAID_*` production
  keys in server `.env` so bank linking works on fihaven.app (previously every
  `PLAID_*` key was stripped from deploy).
- **Plaid webhooks & item lifecycle** — handle `PENDING_DISCONNECT`,
  `LOGIN_REPAIRED`, and `NEW_ACCOUNTS_AVAILABLE`; **Add accounts** (update mode)
  on web, iOS, and Android; account deletion / bank-data clear calls Plaid
  `/item/remove`.
- **Android auth token storage** — `PrefsTokenStore` migrated to Android
  Keystore AES-256-GCM; removed `androidx.security:security-crypto` (one-time
  sign-in may be required after upgrade).
- **Android create-account consent** — the “By creating an account you agree to
  our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy” notice now shows on the Android sign-up
  form (parity with web and iOS).

#### Fixed

- **Android login 401 mapping** — `ApiClient.send()` only throws
  `Unauthenticated` when the server returns `unauthenticated`, not on
  `invalid-credentials` (`ApiClientTest`).
- **Android auth/form UX** — `authScreen()` IME padding + vertical scroll on
  login/MFA/intro/onboarding; `FormDialog` uses `wrapContentHeight` with a max
  height cap.
- **Paid items no longer show overdue** — `effectiveDaysUntilDue` /
  `effectiveDaysUntilBillDue` in `utils.js` and native `DateLogic` / `Schedule`;
  Cards, Bills, and Dashboard upcoming on web, iOS, and Android.
- **Stripe billing portal** — customer lookup via active subscription;
  `stripePortal` flag on `GET /api/billing/status`; Pro dialog shows manage
  only when applicable (`pro.js`, native Paywall/Pro screens).
- **Web More menu** — primary tabs scroll inside `.appbar-nav-scroll`; dropdown
  no longer clipped (`navbar.js`, `components.css`).
- **Settings tab bar** — horizontal scroll wrapper with edge fades
  (`settings.html`, `pages.css`, `settings.js`).
- **Android PendingIntents (CodeQL #31, #32)** — bill-reminder alarm and
  notification tap intents use explicit `setClassName` + `setPackage` via
  `ExplicitIntents.kt`.
- **LinkKit dSYM in CI** — post-build `dsymutil` on Plaid’s LinkKit framework
  was sandbox-blocked in GitHub Actions / Xcode Cloud. Disabled
  `ENABLE_USER_SCRIPT_SANDBOXING` for the FiHaven target, made generation
  best-effort, and declared script inputs/outputs (`project.yml`,
  `Scripts/generate-linkkit-dsym.sh`).
- **iOS Release / TestFlight archives** — Xcode scheme **Archive** and
  **Profile** now use the **Release** configuration (Run/Test stay Debug).
  Release sets `SWIFT_ACTIVE_COMPILATION_CONDITIONS` only on Debug and
  `ENABLE_DEBUG_DYLIB: NO` on Release so `#if DEBUG` tooling (Settings →
  Developer, `FH_AUTOLOGIN`, StoreKit purchase skip) is not compiled into
  TestFlight or App Store binaries. `scripts/ios-testflight.sh` aborts if
  Release still defines the DEBUG compile flag.
- **Native data sync — record ids unified to strings** — bill/card/account/goal
  ids were `Int` on iOS (64-bit) and Android (32-bit) but the web mints string
  ids (`genId`); web/iOS records (and any id > 2³¹) silently failed to decode on
  Android, so cards, bills, accounts, and goals didn’t appear there. All four
  models now use flexible **string** ids on iOS (`flexibleString`) and Android
  (`FlexStringIdSerializer`), and new records mint web-style string ids
  (`newID`/`genId`). Payoff/Subscriptions/Rewards id types and the model checks
  follow suit.
- **Native data sync — full save payload** — `DataPutBody` on iOS and Android
  omitted `accounts`, `goals`, and `transactions`; since `PUT /api/data`
  replaces the whole record, every native save wiped them. All three lists are
  now included in the save body.
- **2FA autofill on Android** — the verification-code field declared no
  autofill type, so the system offered saved passwords. Email, password, and
  the 2FA code field now set Compose `ContentType` (`Username`+`EmailAddress`,
  `Password`/`NewPassword`, `SmsOtpCode`). iOS and web were already correct.
- **Login security check timing out** — Cloudflare Turnstile tokens expire after
  ~5 minutes; sitting on the login screen left a stale/empty token and a
  disabled sign-in button. Widgets now self-refresh on every platform:
  `refresh-expired="auto"` + `retry="auto"` on all three, an auto-reset
  `expired-callback` on web, and the native iOS/Android `TurnstileView` is now
  kept **mounted after it solves** (instead of being unmounted once a token was
  captured) so the held token refreshes before it can expire. A submit still
  resets it (single-use tokens).
- **iOS create-account consent** — the “By creating an account you agree…”
  notice rendered twice; removed the duplicate (and a duplicate
  `accessibilityHint`).
- **Stripe checkout confirmation** — after `?pro=success` the UI didn’t re-check
  entitlement, so it could still show Free until reload (the
  `checkout.session.completed` webhook can land after the redirect). The Pro
  dialog now polls `/api/billing/status` until Pro is active.

#### Documentation

- **README** — Free vs Pro table and Roadmap & gaps; competitive-roadmap
  checklist updated (Tier 1/2 shipped in 1.4.x).
- **`docs/native-contract.md`** — perks, offers, reconcile, `autopayDay`,
  `offerReminders`, and `plaidUpdateBalances`.

## [1.4.2] (Latest Release) — 2026-06-26

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | Released |
| **iOS** | 1.4.2 (8) |
| **Android** | 1.4.2 (build 8) |

### Summary

> Clearer Pro and Family messaging when you sign up, plus a new source-available
> license. [Jump to technical changelog ↓](#142-technical-changelog)

**Pro & Family**

- Intro and onboarding explain what Pro includes (payoff planner, family
  sharing, calendar, rewards, category budgets).
- Paywall and Family settings spell out that invitees can join a household
  for free; Pro is for creating and managing a family.

**Legal & trust**

- Repo license is now **source available** (not AGPL) — code is public for
  transparency; running a competing hosted copy still requires permission.
- Terms of Use clarify how the license relates to using fihaven.app.

**Reliability**

- iOS builds on GitHub CI use the full Xcode toolchain again (fixes broken
  automated builds).

---

<a id="142-technical-changelog"></a>

### Technical changelog

#### Changed

- **License** — replace AGPL-3.0 with the **FiHaven Source Available
  License** ([`docs/source-available.md`](docs/source-available.md)).

  sharing in Pro, source license vs hosted service.
- **Intro Pro step** — feature highlights on web `/welcome`, iOS `IntroView`,
  and Android `IntroScreen`.
- **Post-signup onboarding** — Pro tour step; **See Premium plans** /
  **Continue with Free** on iOS and Android; StoreKit / Play Billing from
  onboarding on Android.
- **Web welcome Pro step** — **Start free trial** (Stripe Checkout), **Get
  Premium**, **Continue with Free** (`welcome.js`).
- **Paywall copy** — Family sharing as a Pro perk on web, iOS, and Android.
- **Settings → Family (non-Pro)** — upgrade entry points; invitees-join-free
  copy; Pro badge on locked Family row (iOS).
- Android `versionCode` 8; iOS **1.4.2 (8)**; [`scripts/ios-testflight.sh`](../scripts/ios-testflight.sh).

#### Fixed

- **iOS CI** — `ios.yml` uses `maxim-lobanov/setup-xcode@v1` (`latest-stable`)
  instead of `swift-actions/setup-swift@v2` (Swift 6.0.3 / SDK mismatch).

## [1.4.1] — 2026-06-26

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | Released |
